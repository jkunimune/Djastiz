# How to Speak Oltilip

This is the language specification for Oltilip, an international auxiliary language. Oltilip was designed to facilitate international communication across all humankind, and as such, is designed to be as neutral, elegant, and easy-to-learn as possible. Here you will find all of the information needed to learn and speak Oltilip, as well as some information about how Oltilip came to be. This document assumes that you speak English. If you're reading this, that seems like a pretty safe assumption.

## Disclaimer

Please do not actually learn this language. I created Oltilip to satisfy my personal desire for a language that _I_ thought was optimal. I publish it such that those who are interested can see my ideas and potentially gain something from them. However, were I to actually push it as a contender for the second language of humanity, it would be a waste of my time at best and another divisive factor in the already splintered auxlang community at worst. Therefore, I beseech you that if you want to support the idea of an international auxiliary language by learning one and communicating with it, I encourage you to look into [Elefen](elefen.org) or [Neo Patwa](http://patwa.pbworks.com/w/page/14800479/FrontPage) instead, as those are the two auxlangs other than my own that I currently favor most.

With that out of the way, let's get onto the language!

## Phonology and orthography

### Alphabet

Before you read any further, you'll need to know how to read, say, and write these words. Luckily, this is extremely easy. Oltilip uses only the seventeen sounds that are most common globally, each of which comes with a considerable amount of allowable variation. For example, while "pace", "base", and "Bess" sound different to most English speakers, all are acceptable pronunciations for Oltilip "pes", which means "fish". Approximately half of all humans can distinguish between all of these sounds in their native phonology, and only 5% need to learn three or more new sounds. The writing system is a simple Latin-derived alphabet with one letter for every sound. It's so simple that a wise man can acquaint himself with it before the hour is over; even a stupid man can learn it in the space of two days.

If you're a linguist, the following [IPA](1) table may prove easier to read:

|               | Labial | Coronal | Palatal | Guttural |

|**Plosive**    |    p   |    t    |         |    k     |
|**Fricative**  |    f   |    s    |  t͡ʃ ⟨c⟩  |    h     |

|**Open** |   a   |      |

The "Inverse" column is not that important; it just comes up later in the derivational morphology section. You don't have to learn that part if you don't want to.

You'll notice that most of the letters match their IPA transcriptions as well as their English counterparts. The only things of which you need to be careful are ⟨j⟩, ⟨c⟩, and the vowels. There's a handy alphabet song in the main repository to help you remember them all if you like.

Note that while all of these symbols come from the Latin alphabet, the Latin alphabet is _not_ the Oltilip alphabet. The Oltilip alphabet does not include ⟨b⟩, ⟨d⟩, ⟨g⟩, ⟨q⟩, ⟨r⟩, ⟨v⟩, ⟨x⟩, ⟨y⟩, ⟨z⟩, or any capital letters. _Some_ capital Latin letters are acceptable substitutes for their lowercase forms, as indicated by the alternate symbols column, but these are merely to allow stylistic variation, and carry no meaning different from their lowercase counterparts. Furthermore, note that unlisted capital letters are too different to be easily readable by Oltilip-speakers who are unfamiliar with the entire Latin alphabet, and thus should not ever be used.

### Punctuation

In addition to this subset of Latin letters, a subset of other Latin symbols may be used with Oltilip to aid parsing. None of these are strictly required, but it is important to understand what they mean in case you come across them in Oltilip texts.

| nak             | F      | Stands for the word "nak" ("fifteen")

### Extensions

Finally, there are twenty-seven more letters that may be used for transcribing foreign names in Oltilip, though it is recommended that foreign names be Oltilipised into the seventeen basic letters when possible. The extensions here are only for cases where two foreign words would be indistinguishable or where the person named prefers that their name be pronounced with a particular phone. They fill out the simplified IPA tables below.

### Phonotactics

Oltilip generally follows a (C)(G)V(G)(C) syllable structure, where any letter can appear in any position according to its class. The only restrictions are the disallowance of double letters and the clusters "ey", "ow", "iy", "uw", "yi", and "wu" within roots. These restrictions are dropped for loanwords. The exception to this syllable structure is the pronoun "l", which can be analysed as a syllabic consonant. However, because it is syntactically always adjacent to a consonant, it need never be pronounced as such.

## Grammar

The grammar of Oltilip is characterised as an analytic, active-stative, head-final system with free word order. In a nutshell, it can be described as:  
         sentence ::= \[sentence-particle\] postposit-phrase\* \[verb-phrase postposit-phrase\*\]  
 postposit-phrase ::= (noun-phrase \| sentence) postposition  
      noun-phrase ::= \[specifier\] (noun \| pronoun \| numeral \| relative-clause \| noun-phrase)\*  
      verb-phrase ::= verb+  
  relative-clause ::= postposit-phrase\* \[verb-phrase postpos-phrase\*\] \["l" postposition\]  
          numeral ::= \[numeral "imal"\] \[\[neg\] digit+\] \["ljo" numeral\]  
         X-phrase ::= \[qualifier \| numeral\] \["bo"\] X-phrase ("ha" X-phrase)\+

Don't know what any of that means? Don't worry. Let's jump into it now.

### Sentence particles

A sentence particle, when included, is the first thing in a sentence or clause. It specifies the mood of that clause: whether it's a statement, a question, etc. There are six.
- "sa" marks a declarative sentence, or indicates acknowledgement when used alone;
- "cu" marks an interrogative sentence, or indicates confusion when used alone;
- "na" marks an imperative sentence, or indicates an implied command when used alone;
- "pana" marks a polite imperative sentence, or indicates an implied request when used alone;
- "wa" marks an exclamatory sentence, or indicates surprise when used alone; and
- "ke" marks a subordinate clause.

When these are used to mark sentences and clauses, the rest of the phrase comprises a series of postpositional phrases, optionally with a predicate included.

### Postpositional phrases

Every postpositional phrase describes one aspect of the event or state described by the clause, and comprises two parts: the _complement_, which is a noun phrase, and the _postposition_, which is drawn from the following list of fifteen. The postposition specifies what aspect of the clause is being described, and the complement describes that aspect. These postpositional phrases may occur in any order. Postpositions can be categorised into two types

_Adjunctive postpositions_ have complements with predictable and general meanings, and can be used with any predicate, or multiple times with the same predicate if used in different contexts (e.g. using "yot" once for location in virtual space and again for location in physical space). There are 
- "yan" marks the extent or quantity of the action, either as a numeral or another noun against which to compare;
- "yot" marks the location of the action;
- "wel" marks the date or time of the action;
- "ial" marks the cause or purpose of the action;
- "uat" marks the tool or medium of the action;
- "ayf" marks the hypothetical conditions surrounding the action (as "if" in English);
- "ip" marks the manner or method of the action, usually as a suborditate clause; and
- "ak" marks something that is related to the action in some other way.

_Argumentative postpositions_ have complements with meanings specific to their predicate, and can only be used once per clause. The definition of each Oltilip verb describes which argumentative postpositions are applicable and what roles they mark, but they can generally be qualified as three classes of semantic role.
- "es" marks the agent of the action, the entity that initialises and carries out the action;
- "on" marks the patient or experiencer, the entity whose state is changed or described by the action; and
- "um" marks the theme or stimulus, an entitty that is not directly involved in the action but is essential to it nonetheless.

### Predicates

The predicate of a clause describes the action or state being described in the most general sense. It usually comprises a single _verb_. In Oltilip, verbs do not conjugate for tense, aspect, or anything else, so "et es nyama" can mean "they had eaten", "they ate", "they are eating", "they eat", or "they will eat". Therefore, if the time of a predicate is important, make sure to manually and specifically include it with "wel".

More complex predicates can be formed by appending other verbs, which serve as auxiliary verbs. This is only valid for verbs that take clauses as arguments, such as "nyo", "calu", "powi", and "tewi". For example, while the sentence "et es pola min on" means "they speak to me", appending "nyo" to the predicate turns it into "et es pola nyo min on", which means "they do not speak to me". This is shorthand for subordinating the entire sentence to "nyo": "et es pola min on on nyo" translates to "it is false that they speak to me".

### Noun phrases

Noun phrases are the primary building blocks with which one describes complex concepts. There are many ways to construct these.

The first, and by far the simplest, is a _noun_. Each one describes an instance or instances of a concept or class of objects. In Oltilip, nouns do not decline for number, gender, or anything else, so "won" can mean "people", "women", "men", "the person", "a woman", or "every man". Therefore, if the quantity or quality of a noun phrase is important, make sure to manually and specifically include it with the mechanisms described below.

Anywhere a noun can be used, one can also opt for a _pronoun_. Like nouns, Oltilip pronouns do not decline at all; most purely indicate person or definiteness. Some of them are fairly common and intuitive, while others are more complicated.
- "min", "me", is the first person pronoun;
- "puk", "you", is the second person pronoun;
- "et", "it" or "that", is the third person, distal, and definite pronoun;
- "ol", "this", is the proximal pronoun;
- "wan", "one", is the indefinite pronoun;
- "sif", "oneself", is the reflexive pronoun;
- "kulan" refers to the next item in the implied series;
- "nitak" refers to the previous item in the implied series;
- "kon" stands in for missing information in interrogative sentences; and
- "l" stands for the referenced noun in _relative clauses_.

Similar to pronouns are _numerals_, which spcifically indicate the number of a noun phrase. They have special derivation rules and are therefore described in the next subsection.

Relative clauses are another kind of noun phrase, and the most versatile. A relative clause is simply any clause, optionally using "ke" as its particle, with "l" optionally inserted as a noun as late as possible in it. It describes anything that could go where "l" is in a full sentence. This is commonly used with stative verbs such as "luci", which means "be red". Since "luci et on" means "it is red", "ke luci l on" or "luci l on" means "one that is red", or "red thing". It is also frequently used with the vague postposition "ak". Since "ciuh ak" describes some action generally related to plants, "ke ciuh ak l on" or "ciuh ak" means "of or related to plants" or "botanical".

A similar but distinct kind of noun phrase is the _content clause_. A content clause is syntactically equivalent to a sentence, except that when it takes a patricle, it always take "ke". Semantically, it references the action or state described by that sentence as a noun. This structure is especially useful for verbs like "calu", "continue", which almost always take content clauses as arguments. The sentence "puk es nyama", "you eat", can be converted into a content clause and used as such as in "puk es nyama on calu": "you eating continues" or "you continue to eat".

Any noun phrase can also be preceeded by a specifier. Specifiers manipulate the meanings of noun phrases that describe sets, and each works in a pretty distinct way.
- "en", "any", indicates that the sentence is true for one element of the noun phrase, regardless of which one is picked;
- "ok", "each", indicates that the sentence is true for every element of the noun phrase individually;
- "alkun", "some", specifies that the sentence is true for some subset of the noun phrase;
- "sol", "only", indicates that the sentence is true for the given noun phrase and nothing else;
- "ifen", "even", emphasises a noun phrase that is surprising or especially important;
- "yo" optionally starts a conjunctive phrase; and
- "aw" separates elements of a conjunctive phrase.

Conjunctive phrases combine noun phrases that reference different things into a single noun phrase, but the exact meaning of the conjunction, like the use of "-slash-" in modern English, is ambiguous. It can be made more specific by adding "ok" or "kit" before the "yo" or first element for an analogue to English's "and", or adding "en", "kan", or "kon" for an analogue to English's "or".

Finally, noun phrases of all kinds can also be concatenated to form more specific ones. When two noun phrases are combined, the resulting meaning is the intersection of both. For example, it is not uncommon for a noun phrase to comprise a pronoun for its definiteness, a numeral for its number, multiple nouns for its class and gender, and a relative clause for added specificity, as in "ifen et tos supot myawf mutilon", "even the two orange tomcats".

### Numerals

The last Oltilip part of speech is the numeral. Oltilip contains many mechanisms for describing numbers in precise mathematical ways, which deserve a Back-Nur all to themselves:

numeral := \[numeral "imal"\] \["men"\] digit\* \["paw" numeral\]

However, for the non-mathemetician, most of this is largely unnecessary. Luckily, basic numbers are also extremely easy to construct. The ten basic numerals are the digits from zero to nine.

|  0  | nul |
|  1  | kan |
|  2  | tos |
|  3  | san |
|  4  | fol |
|  5  | lim |
|  6  | cah |
|  7  | pit |
|  8  | hat |
|  9  | mes |

Numbers larger than nine are described in positional notation, either with or without spaces:

|  10 | kannul |
|  11 | kankan |
|  12 | kantos |
|  20 | tosnul |
|  21 | toskan |
| 100 | kannulnul |
| 1 000 | kan nulnulnul |

This can quickly become unweildly for large orders of magnitude. For that reason, the prefix "lyon" exists. Appending to an existing numeral "lyon" plus another numeral raises its order of magnitude by the second amount. It can be translated as "times ten to the power" or "×10^". So where "kan lim" means "fifteen" and "tos" means "two", "kan lim lyontos" means "fifteen times ten to the power two", "fifteen hundred", or "1 500". "lyontos" can also be used on its own to simply mean "one hundred".

For numbers smaller or more precise than one, the particle "tyen" serves as the radix point. "tyen lim" means "point five", "cah tyen tos hat" means "six point two eight", and "fol tyen nul" means "four point zero".

While it can usually be assumed that this is all in decimal, the system itself is radix-independent. To specify a radix, the base plus the suffix "imal" can be prepended to the number. Digits exist for bases up to 17<sub>10</sub>.

|  A  | tes |
|  B  | tup |
|  C  | set |
|  D  | fak |
|  E  | lef |
|  F  | nak |
|  G  | hes |

Thus, while "kan nul" usually means "tesimal kan nul", the atomic number of neon, it can also be made to mean "cahimal kan nul", the atomic number of carbon, "hesimal kan nul", the atomic number of sulfur, or even "tesimalcahnulimal kan nul", the atomic number of neodymium.

Negative numbers are formed by simply prepending "men" to their opposite, as in "men san". These can also be used with "lyon", as in "hat tyen mes lyon men kan tos". When it is useful to emphasize the sign of a positive number, this can be done with the otherwise meaningless prefix "pok", as in "pok kan aw men kan".

Fractions are formed with the separator "pel", which simply divides the numeral before it by the numeral after it. For example, "tostos pel pit".

Finally, three subjective numerals exist for siutations when a number would not typically be used in English.
- "pih" means some small quantity;
- "muc" means some large quantity; and
- "kit" means the maximum possible quantity given the context.
These can be used in tandem with other numbers, as in "muc nul nul" for "many hundreds", but are usually used alone, more like pronouns.

### "Do no wrong" principle

### Tips and tricks

That's all of the official grammar. You may find it rather short. "Where are the tenses, the passives, the participles?" you ask. While these do not exist explicitly in Oltilip, they can be expressed using preexisting structures. Therefore, while their inclusion here is not strictly necessary, I will explain them so that everyone understands best practices for such situations without needing derive them themselves.

Tenses are simple. If it is important to a sentence whether it happened in the past, present, or future, the dative postposition `eh` can be used with the appropriate word.

Passives are somewhat nonexistent in Launtoklian, since you can just switch the order anyway.

Participles in Launtoklian are represented with relative clauses.

Adverbs come in two flavours: things like "quickly" and things like "hopefully".

Directionals

Conjunctions

Other postpositions

Adjective derivations

The verb "to have"

The verb "to need"

## Vocabulary

Oltilip has 426 basic roots, drawn from Chinese, Italic, Germanic, Indo-Iranian, Atlantic-Congo, Malayo-Polynesian, Esperanto, and onomotopoetic lexicons. The source languages were selected and weighted in order to give the most mnemonic value to the greatest number of people. These roots fall into five parts of speech—nouns, verbs, numerals, specifiers, and sentence particles—which will be explained in the next section. While these root words cover many concepts, with only 426, there are inevitably many lexical gaps and ambiguities. These are filled with Oltilip's morphological derivation system. New words are derived in three main ways: _inversion_, _compounds_, _affixes_, and _loans_.

### Inversion

Inversion is by far the least intuitive and most unique of the four. It is used to derive antonyms and opposites of verbs and nouns. For example, the word for "to be near", "nito", is derived by inverting the word for "to be far", "kule". This is accomplished by simply replacing every letter in "kule" with its inverse letter, as specified in the phonology table in section ?. The "ke" goes to "na", the "u" goes to "i", the "la" goes to "ta", and the "e" goes to "o".

### Compound words

A more standard way to form a new word is with a simple compound. This involves combining two or more existing words to form a new one. It takes the part of speech of the second, and represents something between the meanings of both. For example, "pahopoltilum", meaning "underwear", is derived from "paho", meaning "to be under", and "poltilum", meaning "clothing".

One of the most common uses of this system is the creation of demonyms and language names. In Oltilip, a loanword may represent a country or people group, depending on which is named after the other. If a loanword is used for the country, then the demonym is derived by combining it with "won", "person". If the people, then the toponym is derived by combining it with "tec", "country". Either way, the loanword can be combined with the word "tilip", "language", to describe the language of that country, or with the word "kwelyot", "place", to describe a geographic area. For example, "'alap" is the Oltilip word for "Arab" or "the Arabian people". Saudi Arabia is then "'alaptec", the Arabic language is "'alaptilip", and the Arabian peninsula is "'alapkwelyot".

### Affixes

A more precise way to derive new terms is through the addition af affixes. In Oltilip, all affixes are themselves words, and the result of adding one means the same thing as the base word and affix placed together in a sentence, albeit lexicalised. For example, if the relative pronoun "les" is placed next to the verb "noki", which means "to know", one gets "noki les", which means "one who teaches". When "les" is used as a suffix, that phrase is lexicalised into "nokiles", which means "teacher". This form carries two concrete advantages over the phrase "noki les"; specifically, "nokiles" cannot be interpreted as two words in adjacent phrases should the surrounding grammar be complicated, and further can refer to the concept of a teacher even when there is no one in the discussion who is currently teaching. Learning a word like "nokiles" is also inherently easier than repeatedly parsing a phrase like "noki les".

There are ten suffixes that can turn verbs into nouns:
- "-les" references the agent of a verb, similar to "-er" in English,
- "-lon" references the patient of a verb, similar to "-ee" in English,
- "-lum" references the theme of a verb,
- "-lyan" references the extent to which a verb takes place,
- "-lwel" references the time at which a verb takes place,
- "-lyot" references the location at which a verb takes place,
- "-lial" references the cause because of which verb takes place,
- "-luat" references the instrument by which verb takes place, and
- "-lip" references the way in which a verb takes place.

There are four suffixes that can turn verbs into other verbs:
- "-nyo" describes the negative of a verb, similar to "non-" in English,
- "-ki" describes the inception of a verb, similar to "-ise" or "-en" in English,
- "-nu" describes the cession of a verb, similar to "de- -ise" or "un- -en" in English,
- "-powi" describes the potential of a verb, similar to "-able" or "-ible" in English, and
- "-calu" describes the continuation of a verb.

Finally, there is one suffix that turns nouns into other nouns:
- "-ak" describes anything of or related to a noun, similar to "-al", "-ic", or "-'s" in English.

### Loanwords

For words that describe deeply technical concepts like deoxyribonucleic acid, cultural concepts like ahupua&#8216;a, or a combination of the two like the oriental ladyfern, a class of word that is neither root nor  preferred method of denotation is the loanword, a word taken directly from other languages. Loanwords in Musical Djastiz use Modern Djastiz's phonology. The word should be taken from a language that has regional or historical ties to the concept. For example, a specific species of fox should have a word loaned from a language sung in a region where that fox is or was found. Gramatically, loanwords are equivalent to nouns. Note that this is also the preferred method for generating toponyms, even when the country in question uses a compound word in the native language. For example, "'doyc" means "German"

Like the compound words, the set of documented loanwords is not complete. They are meant to encompass the highly specific concepts that Djastiz cannot describe on its own, and thus to attempt to recond all of them in a Djastiz dictionary would be impossible. Instead, I have included some useful examples of loanwords in [loanword.csv](dictionary/loanword.csv).

## Common phrases

## Flag

The flag of Oltilip is a white and blue azure bicolour, divided by a sinusoid. In the center, it bears an orange six-pointed star circumscribed by an azure and white circle. The white field represents peace, which Oltilip could facilitate, while the azure represents knowledge, which Oltilip could perpetuate. The line between them is a sinusoid instead of the traditional straight line to represent the fluidity of Oltilip's grammar, and its free word order in particular. The circle represents the Earth---blue, white, and circular. The star both separates it into six sections, the six continents, and bridges the gap between them. It represents language, and Oltilip specifically---something that can separate us, but also something that can keep us together.
