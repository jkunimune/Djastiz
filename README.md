# International Chastisun

Chastisun is an international language.

## Key features

As an auxlang, Chastisun is designed to be as easy as possible for everyone to learn and use. Thus, in creating it, I followed three basic priorities:

* Simplicity -- there should be as little to learn as possible, without sacrificing usability.
* Flexibility -- speakers should be able to include as much or as little information as necessary.
* Elegance -- unknown structures should be inferrable from known ones, when possible.

With these goals in mind, I developed a language with the following key features:

* Seventeen common phonemes; five vowels and twelve consonants
* 700 morphemes with thousands of derivatives and compounds
* Partially self-segregating morphology
* Stative verbs in lieu of adjectives
* Completely anlytic
* Left-branching
* Active-stative
* Postposition-facilitated free word order
