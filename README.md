# Oltilip

Oltilip (/oʊ̯lˈtɪlɪp/; Oltilip: ⟨oltilip⟩ \[olˈtilip\]) is the ultimate international language. So easy to learn, so well-supported, and so elegant that the world won't be able to help but speak it. That's the plan, anyway. Here, you'll find eveything you need to learn it (albeit not in the easiest format) and all the source code needed to reproduce my work.

## Key features

As an auxlang, Oltilip is designed to be as easy as possible for everyone to learn and use. Thus, in creating it, I followed three basic priorities:

* Simplicity -- there should be as little to learn as possible, without sacrificing usability.
* Flexibility -- speakers should be able to include as much or as little information as necessary.
* Elegance -- unknown structures should be inferrable from known ones, when possible.

With these goals in mind, I developed a language with the following key features:

* Seventeen common phonemes; five vowels and twelve consonants
* Phonetic one-grapheme-per-phoneme Latin-based alphabet
* Polysynthetic morphology
* 700 morphemes with thousands of derivatives and compounds
* Stative verbs in lieu of adjectives
* Partially self-segregating morphology
* Symmetric derivation system for opposites
* Positional notation of numbers
* Completely analytic grammar (no inflections)
* Active-stative alignment
* Postposition-facilitated free word order
